# Image2TexturesPlus

A command line tool that scans all PNGs in the current directory, and generates
a per-pixel reconstruction of said graphics in TEXTURES format.

How to use:

Place Image2TexturesPlus.exe in the same directory as your graphics and simply
run the application. An "Output.txt" will be generated - just copy and paste
the output to where it needs to be in your project hierarchy.

- OR -

Add Image2TexturesPlus.exe into your Windows PATH variable so that you can
invoke it from any directory.

You will need an image called "pixel" placed into /patches in your project for
the reconstruction to be successful; I have included it in this package!
